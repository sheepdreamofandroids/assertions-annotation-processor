# assertions-annotation-processor
Inspired by assertj, generates assertion helpers.

The goal is to make writing assertions easier. It does it by wrapping the objects that the assertions are about in a wrapper with a fluent api. This way the code can be shorter and assertions can be discovered using autocomplete.
